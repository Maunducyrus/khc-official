                <h3 class="subheading purple-text">Who We Are</h3>
                <p>The Krypto Hashers Community, or just KHC, is not your typical open-source group chasing stars or
                    clout. We're a raw, unfiltered group of devs who simply build things because we feel like it. This
                    is a space for real developers solving real problems, not for applause, but for the sheer joy of
                    creating.</p>
                <p>Whether it's a bot that comments "bruh" when a build fails, or an automation script that reminds you
                    to drink water at 3AM, we believe in building what we wish existed.</p>
                <p>KHC welcomes anyone—from the curious beginner who just wrote their first loop, to the senior dev who
                    writes tools for fun in the middle of the night. We don't care about your tech stack, your years of
                    experience, or how many stars your repo has. If you love creating, breaking, and learning, you
                    belong here.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-right">
                <h3 class="subheading blue-text">What We Believe</h3>
                <p>We value collaboration over competition, questions over credentials, and ideas over perfection. Our
                    discussions are wild, our projects are sometimes ridiculous, but our intentions are always sincere.
                </p>
                <p>Whether you're building the next big automation, shipping a tool to help your workflow, or just
                    adding
                    memes to the README—we see you. And we're glad you're here.</p>
                <p>KHC isn't a company. It's not a club. It's a mindset. One where chaos, curiosity, and creativity come
                    together to form something truly meaningful.</p>
                <p>So if you've ever stayed up all night debugging something stupid, laughed at your own code, or wished
                    you
                    had people to just vibe with and learn from—welcome home. This is KHC.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">How It Started</h2>
        <div class="story-content">
            <div class="started-left">
                <p>It all started in a small room, with me—just a regular developer, no team, no community—just a
                    laptop, no chai, and a thousand bugs I couldn't solve. Every time I hit a wall, I'd head straight to
                    Stack Overflow, searching endlessly through GitHub issues, hoping someone out there had already
                    cried over the same problem.</p>
                <p>Sometimes I found gold. Sometimes I found… complete chaos. And then, I got stuck. So stuck that I
                    stopped building. I gave up halfway through projects. I left ideas in folders, never opened again.
                    That creative spark slowly dimmed, and I just couldn't get myself to open the terminal again.</p>
                <p>But deep down, I still wanted to build. I still believed in the joy of making something out of
                    nothing. One day, a random dev came across one of my old projects. He didn't just star it—he fixed a
                    bug I left broken for months.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="started-right">

                <p>That one pull request brought everything back. We talked, we collaborated, we laughed at weird bugs
                    together, and we slowly started building again. That's when it clicked: there must be more people
                    like me.</p>
                <p>People who love building but don't always have the energy to keep going alone. People who just need a
                    little nudge, a teammate, a shared repo. That's how Krypto Hashers Community was born—not from plans
                    or frameworks, but from burnout and revival. From silence and spark.</p>
                <p>Since 2021, we've been around—quietly messing with ideas, breaking stuff, fixing some of it, and
                    making friends along the way. Now, we're ready to open our doors and say: if you've ever stopped
                    building and wished someone would help you start again… this is your sign.</p>
